chess-game-v2
=======

A simple chess game web game with both a frontend which mainly utilises canvas and a backend server.
This is my second attempt at this idea after a miserable first attemptðŸ˜….

*All chess pictures and icons are from ui-icons by [flaticon](https://flaticon.com).*

## How to play

### Starting the server
*You need to have `node` and `git` installed on your computer to run this project.*

Run the following code in your terminal of choice:
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DevJesseCode/chess-game-v2

# Navigate to the repository folder
cd chess-game-v2

# Start the server
node server.js
```

You should get the following output:
```text
Server is running
Location: *The project folder*
Address: 127.0.0.1:8080
```
*Whenever you want to run the project, remember to start the server using `node server.js` from the project directory*

Start your browser and open the server address. By default, the server address is 127.0.0.1:8080
